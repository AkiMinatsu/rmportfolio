        From a young age, art has been my passion. What started as a hobby soon evolved into a journey of creativity and growth. Over the years, I expanded my skills from sketching to painting, crafting, and working with various mediums.

        During Senior High, I pursued the Arts and Design Track, refining my artistic techniques. Since Grade 6, I’ve actively participated in art competitions and explored fashion design, creating gowns for special events. Now, as a Bachelor of Fine Arts Major in Advertising at Technological University of the Philippines Manila, I continue to grow as an artist. Alongside commissions for portraits, costume design, makeup, and wig styling, my work in the cosplay community has opened new creative opportunities.

        I’m excited to keep evolving as an artist and look forward to bringing my vision to life through my art.
